# Comprehensive Analysis of Retail Sales Data

## Overview
This project performs an in-depth analysis of a transactional dataset from a UK-based online retail business. The dataset contains transactions recorded between **01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011** and was sourced from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository**. 

Key techniques used include **cohort analysis** and **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) segmentation** to analyze customer behavior, identify trends, and support targeted marketing strategies.

For a detailed step-by-step explanation and key findings, visit the project page: [Comprehensive Analysis of Retail Sales Data](https://www.datawithjas.com/projects/comprehensive-analysis-of-retail-sales-data).

## Key Methodologies and Tools

- **Data Preprocessing**: SQL and Pandas were used to clean, transform, and enrich the dataset with additional tables.
- **Data Integration**: Python script was developed to automate data scraping from external sources.
- **Visualization & Analytics**: Power BI dashboards with DAX calculations were built for interactive insights.
